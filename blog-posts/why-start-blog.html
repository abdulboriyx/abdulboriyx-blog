  <h1 class="blog-header">Why did I start this blog?</h1>
  <p class="blog-text">Before starting this personal blog website, I tried running several Telegram channels on different topics but ended up deleting almost all of them. I’m not entirely sure why I deleted them, or perhaps I don’t want to admit the reasons. Eventually, I decided to create my own webpage to write blogs. This decision was inspired by the blogs of Naval Ravikant, Sam Altman, and Paul Graham. They motivated me to start this blog, even though I initially lacked reliable reasons. However, I later questioned myself and came up with three solid reasons to start this blog.</p>
  <p class="blog-text">Firstly, my grandchildren are the primary and most essential reason for this blog. In my 60s, they might ask me questions like, "Granddaddy, what did you do when you were young?" The most dreadful answer I fear giving is, "I just worked to feed my family, five days a week, and chilled out at home on weekends." Then, they might think, "Well, I need to find a hero or ideal to follow." I want to write my reflections, thoughts, experiences, failures, successes, and stories, like "How I met your grandma," and so on. This way, we, with my grandchildren, can discuss, laugh, and remember those memories that will inspire my them and help them see me as their ideal or hero.</p>
  <p class="blog-text">Secondly, I wanted my blog to be free from views, likes, dislikes, and comments so that I can address my issues with external validation and attention-seeking. This is also one of the most essential reasons for starting this blog. Attention-seeking and external validation habits have been detrimental to my mental state and my soul. Therefore, I want to write on thought-provoking topics purely for the sake of writing, without the need for likes, validation, views, comments, and so on.</p>
<p class="blog-text">Thirdly, I want to write my thoughts on different topics, question myself, delve deeper into my ideas, challenge my biases, and work on overcoming them. Additionally, I aim to improve my writing and English skills, which are essential for achieving my career goals.</p>
<p class="blog-text">These are the main reasons for starting this blog. I hope to write on challenging topics while creating value for myself, my grandchildren, and anyone who visits this blog. I'll do my best to achieve this.</p>
