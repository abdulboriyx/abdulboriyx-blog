      <p class="blog-text">
            It has been two and half months that I posted last blog. Since then, I didn't write anything. Nothing is inspiring me. I wrote and deleted posts about "Last Supper", "Bin Laden", "What is the point of Life", "How life began according to X", "Kendirck Lamar", "Childhood trauma" and many others which I even didn't write. I don't know why I can't write, I really don't. One reason is I think I don't either of topics above deeply. There is some perception that I am just shallow on so many topics. I need to deepen them. Whatever. I try to write about something, I really do. If anyone reads this and have idea what to write, please share I might write about. <br> <br>
            
            
            I was inspired by Paul Graham, Naval and Altman when I started this blog. I really thought I would spend time doing researches and writing about different topics on this blog. But I have realized I lack the time and knowledge. The differenc between those people and me is experience and wisdom, and I want to spend time gaining knowledge and experience, before writing about different things. Their blog have been living for decades, and I hope mine does too because I want my kid to read my blog posts. <br> <br>
            
            So, if you, my kid (or kids), are reading this, I want to share something essential: all the blogs, projects, grades and efforts to sound smart - it is all just to impress your mom. We haven't met yet, but this is gonna happen soon. After reading this blog, let me know if I won her heart. (Though, immodestly, I have no doubt that she'll choose me). Love!
