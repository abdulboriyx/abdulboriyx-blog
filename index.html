  <h1 class="blog-header">Bearing Oneself</h1>
  <p class="blog-text"> For about 10 days, I searched for a topic to write about. I don’t know why, but I couldn’t finish any: these were the topics I tried to write about but couldn’t complete: The Meaning of Life According to X, The Last Supper, How Life Was Started According to Abrahamic Religions, Hamas, Bin Laden. But none of them worked. <a href="./blog-posts/solitude.html" class="blog-link">More</a></p>

  <h1 class="blog-header">A learned heart can't unlearn!</h1>
  <p class="blog-text"> Last year, I was addicted to doomscrolling on YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. It affected my attention span and focus, so I decided to overcome this addiction. I realized I was mistaken in trying to overcome the addiction by merely fighting its symptoms rather than addressing the root cause. Undergoing a social media detox helped me understand that doomscrolling was just a coping mechanism, not the core issue—it was my life problems that needed addressing. Intrigued by this topic, I wanted to delve deeper since it is a global problem.<a href="./blog-posts/addiction.html" class="blog-link">More</a></p>

<!-- Experience, not age -->
<div class="blog-content blog-two">
  <h1 class="blog-header">It's not the years, honey. It's the mileage</h1>
  <p class="blog-text">"The mind is in the head, not in the age." This phrase was one of the most hated phrases in my life because it was used against me a lot when I spent summer vacations in the country at my grandmother's house. I was born and lived in a town between the city and the countryside. I was not good at farming or gardening. For this reason, I was criticized a lot at my grandmother's house, and my nephews there, even though they were 3-4 years younger than me, could do things properly. Now that I think about it, I understand that this phrase should be a lesson for me, and I should follow it instead of hating it. In this post, I'm going to write about why experience really matters, not age. <a href="./blog-posts/age-matter.html" class="blog-link">More</a></p>

  <!-- Why did I start? -->
<div class="blog-content blog-one">
  <h1 class="blog-header">Why did I start this blog?</h1>
  <p class="blog-text">Before starting this personal blog website, I tried running several Telegram channels on different topics but ended up deleting almost all of them. I’m not entirely sure why I deleted them, or perhaps I don’t want to admit the reasons. Eventually, I decided to create my own webpage to write blogs. This decision was inspired by the blogs of Naval Ravikant, Sam Altman, and Paul Graham. They motivated me to start this blog, even though I initially lacked reliable reasons. However, I later questioned myself and came up with three solid reasons to start this blog. <a class="blog-link" href="blog-posts/why-start-blog.html">More</a></p>
