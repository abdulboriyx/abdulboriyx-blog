<!-- Inspirations -->

  <h1 class="blog-header">Inspirations</h1>
  <p class="blog-text"> Today's post is going to be a bit different from previos ones. I am not going to share it on my telegram channel or any social media. I just want to write this one for myself. </i> <br> <br>
      
    There are many great people out there to get inspired by. For instance, Cristiano, Einstein, Newton, Tyson, Muhammad Ali, Michael Jordan, Michael Phelps, Federer, Messi, you name it. Today, I want to write my inspirations and why they inspire me, it is going to be mixture of different people from very different fields. <a href="./blog-posts/inspirations.html" class="blog-link">More</a></p>

<!-- Consciousness -->
<div class="blog-content blog-three">
  <h1 class="blog-header">Consciousness</h1>
  <p class="blog-text"> It was either Tuesday or Thursday afternoon. I was on campus since there were classes. I came into the convenience store, bought my food, and went out to eat it. Usually, I watch videos on YouTube while eating lunch, especially if I am alone. The documentary from Google DeepMind had been popping up for several days. I decided to watch it, and it literally changed my interest. It was about AlphaGo and how it won against World Champion Go (Eastern Asian board game) player Lee Sedol (a Korean dude). I got really interested because it showed how AlphaGo learned to play Go itself and beat the best player in the world. I became a fan of its CEO, Demis Hassabis. Then I watched a couple of his other interviews and podcasts. On his podcast with Lex Fridman, he talked about consciousness and philosophy, which made me curious to learn about this topic. I have played around with this topic for some time, and finally, now I have written a short overview: What is consciousness? <a href="./blog-posts/consciousness.html" class="blog-link">More</a></p>

<!-- Founder -->
<div class="blog-content blog-three">
  <h1 class="blog-header">Founder</h1>
  <p class="blog-text"> I got my first paid job when I was 12 and used the money I earned to buy a bag for school. Since then, I’ve had a few part-time jobs, and through these experiences, I’ve learned a lot about the essential skills and qualities needed to build a business or startup. I wanted to clarify these lessons and write them down to reflect on what I’ve learned so far. I’ve shared my experiences as an employee in various roles and my thoughts on what makes a good founder. While I know I don’t have much experience yet and my ideas will likely evolve over time, these are the observations I’ve made so far. <a href="./blog-posts/work.html" class="blog-link">More</a></p>

<!-- God! -->
<div class="blog-content blog-three">
  <h1 class="blog-header">God!</h1>
  <p class="blog-text">When I was in school, most adults were people who were born and lived, at least briefly, during the period of Soviet Union. We, as young pupils, were told that Soviet’s education system was better, strict and even that poor-performing students at that time were better than bright students in Independent Uzbekistan. I don’t know whether this is true or not but I know for sure that Soviets taught what they were beneficial for them and their agenda. <a href="./blog-posts/god.html" class="blog-link">More</a></p>

  <h1 class="blog-header">Bearing Oneself</h1>
  <p class="blog-text"> For about 10 days, I searched for a topic to write about. I don’t know why, but I couldn’t finish any: these were the topics I tried to write about but couldn’t complete: The Meaning of Life According to X, The Last Supper, How Life Was Started According to Abrahamic Religions, Hamas, Bin Laden. But none of them worked. <a href="./blog-posts/solitude.html" class="blog-link">More</a></p>

<div class="blog-content blog-two">
  <h1 class="blog-header">A learned heart can't unlearn!</h1>
  <p class="blog-text"> Last year, I was addicted to doomscrolling on YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. It affected my attention span and focus, so I decided to overcome this addiction. I realized I was mistaken in trying to overcome the addiction by merely fighting its symptoms rather than addressing the root cause. Undergoing a social media detox helped me understand that doomscrolling was just a coping mechanism, not the core issue—it was my life problems that needed addressing. Intrigued by this topic, I wanted to delve deeper since it is a global problem.<a href="./blog-posts/addiction.html" class="blog-link">More</a></p>

<!-- Experience, not age -->
<div class="blog-content blog-two">
  <h1 class="blog-header">It's not the years, honey. It's the mileage</h1>
  <p class="blog-text">"The mind is in the head, not in the age." This phrase was one of the most hated phrases in my life because it was used against me a lot when I spent summer vacations in the country at my grandmother's house. I was born and lived in a town between the city and the countryside. I was not good at farming or gardening. For this reason, I was criticized a lot at my grandmother's house, and my nephews there, even though they were 3-4 years younger than me, could do things properly. Now that I think about it, I understand that this phrase should be a lesson for me, and I should follow it instead of hating it. In this post, I'm going to write about why experience really matters, not age. <a href="./blog-posts/age-matter.html" class="blog-link">More</a></p>

  <!-- Why did I start? -->
<div class="blog-content blog-one">
  <h1 class="blog-header">Why did I start this blog?</h1>
  <p class="blog-text">Before starting this personal blog website, I tried running several Telegram channels on different topics but ended up deleting almost all of them. I’m not entirely sure why I deleted them, or perhaps I don’t want to admit the reasons. Eventually, I decided to create my own webpage to write blogs. This decision was inspired by the blogs of Naval Ravikant, Sam Altman, and Paul Graham. They motivated me to start this blog, even though I initially lacked reliable reasons. However, I later questioned myself and came up with three solid reasons to start this blog. <a class="blog-link" href="blog-posts/why-start-blog.html">More</a></p>
